THINGS TO DO:
	
move any target specific code to drivers package:

*** BasicButton, redo to consider View injection (allows for animated states) and add cursor control (EMouseCursor and isVisible) to InputMouse to prevent need for drivers
* Entity constructor driver (should it be View injection?)
* InputAll review overrides and make native templates instead
** Overlay flash driver
** Profiler flash driver
** SceneTransition flash driver
* Tools - remove invSqrt flash memory?
*** adopt p_ hungarian?
