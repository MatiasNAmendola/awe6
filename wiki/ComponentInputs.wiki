[https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IInputManager.html https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/images/icons/inputs.png]

User input comes in many forms, and this component handles them and provides an easy unified interface to their state: mouse, keyboard, virtual joypad.

== Things you should know about Inputs ==

  * [https://code.google.com/p/awe6/source/browse/trunk/app/src/awe6/core/InputManager.hx InputManager] comes ready to run with working implementations for Mouse, Keyboard and virtual Joypads.  Multitouch support coming soon.
  * Inputs are state based, rather than event based - so code queries the current state of a button, key, position etc.  Use [https://code.google.com/p/awe6/source/browse/trunk/app/src/awe6/extras/Trigger.hx Trigger] + [ComponentMessages Messages] if you want to "listen".
  * Implements [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IInputManager.html IInputManager].
  
== Did you know? ==

  * Unlimited virtual Joypads can be created and run concurrently - e.g. for multiplayer games.
