  * [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/app/src/awe6/core/InputManager.hx InputManager] comes ready to run with working input implementations for Mouse, Keyboard and a virtual Joypad.  Multitouch support soon.
  * Inputs are state based, rather than event based - so code queries the current state of a button, key, position etc.  Use [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/app/src/awe6/extras/Trigger.html Trigger] + [ComponentMessages] if you want to "listen".
  * Implements [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IInputManager.html IInputManager].
