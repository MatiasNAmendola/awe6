#summary Key Components: Preloader

[https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IPreloader.html https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/images/icons/preloader.png]

All runtime loaded assets must be loaded (at runtime!), the Preloader does this, displays visual updates and proceeds to the next stage in initialisation once completed.

== Things you should know about Preloader ==

  * [https://code.google.com/p/awe6/source/browse/trunk/app/src/awe6/core/APreloader.hx APreloader] comes ready to run (it's created automatically in the default [ComponentFactory Factory]).
  * Preloader automatically loads in assets defined in the config XML file: settings.assets.url1...
  * Any assets used before the Preloader has completed must be compiled into the root application (as they are not yet available).
  * Implements [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IPreloader.html IPreloader].
  
== Did you know? ==

  * The default Preloader registers Fonts with names corresponding to [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/ETextStyle.html ETextStyle] automatically.
