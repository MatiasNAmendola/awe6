#summary Develop for mobile devices using awe6.

[https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/images/IosMockup.jpg]

You can readily deploy your awe6 powered games to multiple mobile devices (e.g. iOS, Android).  There are various approaches, each with its respective pros and cons.  Please note the author of awe6 is a fan of SWF & HTML5 as they represent ubiquitous platforms (today and tomorrow respectively) and there are many HTML5 accelerators now available in this space.

==NME==

[http://haxenme.org NME] is Haxe's homegrown solution to deploying multimedia to C++ devices.  The NME library wraps the C++ SDL library into a familiar flash like API - it is therefore extremely fast!

To use awe6 with your NME project add the following line to your NME project's nmml file:

{{{
<haxelib name="awe6" />
}}}

Alternatively create a new awe6 NME project using the templates included in the haxelib installation.  See QuickStart for more information.

Please note many subtle variances currently exist between the NME and Flash APIs so code methodically and consider fallbacks.  Specifically avoid frequent draw(), masks, filters, negative matrix transformations or complex Sounds.  The other drawback of NME is that existing ActionScript libraries may not be available to your project.

==Adobe AIR==

Converts any SWF to a mobile app.  The majority of the Flash API is available and works generally as expected.

To deploy to iOS a Mac is not required.  No fee (other than iOS Developer Membership) is incurred.  Follow these steps to target your game to Web via awe6 + Flash Player, iPhone, iPod, iPad, Android via awe6 + AIR:

 # Install [http://www.adobe.com/products/air/sdk/ AIR SDK (2.7+)].
 # Follow the [QuickStart Quick Start Tutorial] and build an awe6 application.
 # Compile your application using compiler flag `-D awe6Air` (this disables some minor incompatible aspects within the flash driver).
 # iOS: Build the generated swf into an AIR app using [http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WSfffb011ac560372f3cb56e2a12cc36970aa-8000.html Adobe's Help].
 # Android: Build the generated swf into an AIR app using [http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS901d38e593cd1bac25d3d8c712b2d86751e-8000.html Adobe's Help].

Note: deployment to iOS requires a valid membership of the Apple Developer iOS program.  Certificate creation and application packaging can be done from either a Mac or Windows following [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/packaging-air-apps-ios.html these steps].  Final push to iTunes requires a Mac (perhaps borrow a friend's, if you don't own one?).

Performance on mobile devices using AIR 2.7+ is promising if proper coding discipline is adhered to.  Be strict and consider memory management including object pooling (to avoid GC calls) in your Entities and make effective use of flash.display.Bitmap (which has been optimised for use with mobile devices).  Using GPU specific libraries (e.g. Starling) is also increasingly effective.
