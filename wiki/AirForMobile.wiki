awe6 powered games have been deployed to multiple mobile devices (iOS and Android).  A Mac is not required.  No fee (other than iOS Developer Membership) is incurred.  Follow these steps to target your game to Web via awe6 + Flash Player, iPhone, iPod, iPad, Android via awe6 + AIR:

 # Install [http://www.adobe.com/products/air/sdk/ AIR SDK (2.7+)].
 # Follow the [QuickStart Quick Start Tutorial] and build awe6 demo from Trunk.
 # Build the AIR target using [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/app/awe6Air.hxml awe6Air.hxml].  Note: the "air" conditional compilation tag disables some minor incompatible aspects (e.g. ContextMenu).
 # iOS: Build the generated "app.swf" into an AIR app using [http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WSfffb011ac560372f3cb56e2a12cc36970aa-8000.html Adobe's Help].
 # Android: Build the generated "app.swf" into an AIR app using [http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS901d38e593cd1bac25d3d8c712b2d86751e-8000.html Adobe's Help].

Note: deployment to iOS requires a valid membership of the Adobe Developer iOS program.  Certificate creation and application packaging can be done from either a Mac or Windows following [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/packaging-air-apps-ios.html these steps].  Final push to iTunes requires a Mac (perhaps borrow a friend's, if you don't own one?).

Performance on mobile devices using AIR 2.7+ is promising if proper coding discipline is adhered to.  Be strict and consider memory management including object pooling in your Entities and blitting / copyPixels in your Views.

An alternative approach to using Adobe AIR is to use other haXe libraries to target multiple platforms ([http://blog.krozalski.com/?p=1 Krzysztof Różalski] reported that performance might be better via these routes).  Therefore the "multiTarget" branch of awe6 is experimenting with both [https://launchpad.net/jeash Jeash] (JS) and [http://code.google.com/p/nekonme/ NME] (CPP).  If you can help, we welcome contribution to this project.
