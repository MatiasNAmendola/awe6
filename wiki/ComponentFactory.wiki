#summary Everything gets made at the Factory!

[https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IFactory.html https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/images/icons/factory.png]

The Factory creates and populates the [ComponentKernel Kernel], all managers and provides answers to runtime configuration requests (like where to go next, or what font a title should be).

== Things you should know about Factory ==

  * [https://code.google.com/p/awe6/source/browse/trunk/app/src/awe6/core/AFactory.hx AFactory] contains almost everything you need out of the tin.  Extend this class, override a few methods and you're running!
  * AFactory takes configuration data (e.g. string, XML etc) and a native application node (e.g. !DisplayObject) and builds everything from there using a template pattern.
  * Implements [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IFactory.html IFactory].
