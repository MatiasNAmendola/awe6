#summary Key Components: Messages

[https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IMessageManager.html https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/images/icons/messages.png]

Entities can communicate directly using invoker methods or indirectly via observer pattern using Messages.  Messages are synchronous, typed signals which some developers may find useful.

== Things you should know about Messages ==

  * [https://code.google.com/p/awe6/source/browse/trunk/app/src/awe6/core/MessageManager.hx MessageManager] comes ready to run (it's automatically composed in [ComponentKernel Kernel]).
  * Any [ComponentEntity Entity] can subscribe to messages from any other Entity (or type of Entity).
  * Messages can be anything, from simple strings to complex types.  Handlers are type safe.
  * Messages are rarely needed as they can be unreliable.  Use [https://code.google.com/p/awe6/source/browse/trunk/app/src/awe6/extras/Trigger.hx Triggers] instead.
  * Implements [https://awe6.googlecode.com/svn/tags/api/types/awe6/interfaces/IMessageManager.html IMessageManager].
  
== Did you know? ==

  * Messages can bubble up, down, or across the entire [ComponentScene Scene], and even automatically self unsubscribe on send.
